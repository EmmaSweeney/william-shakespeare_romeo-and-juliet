			<h3>SCENE I. A public place.</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<i>Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants</i>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>BENVOLIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Thou art like one of those fellows that when he</a>
				<br/>
				<a>enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword</a>
				<br/>
				<a>upon the table and says 'God send me no need of</a>
				<br/>
				<a>thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws</a>
				<br/>
				<a>it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>BENVOLIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Am I like such a fellow?</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as</a>
				<br/>
				<a>any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as</a>
				<br/>
				<a>soon moody to be moved.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>BENVOLIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>And what to?</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Nay, an there were two such, we should have none</a>
				<br/>
				<a>shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou</a>
				<br/>
				<a>wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no</a>
				<br/>
				<a>other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what</a>
				<br/>
				<a>eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of</a>
				<br/>
				<a>meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as</a>
				<br/>
				<a>an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a</a>
				<br/>
				<a>man for coughing in the street, because he hath</a>
				<br/>
				<a>wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing</a>
				<br/>
				<a>his new doublet before Easter? with another, for</a>
				<br/>
				<a>tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou</a>
				<br/>
				<a>wilt tutor me from quarrelling!</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>BENVOLIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man</a>
				<br/>
				<a>should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>The fee-simple! O simple!</a>

				<a>By my head, here come the Capulets.</a>

			<blockquote>
				<a>By my heel, I care not.</a>

			<a>
				<b>TYBALT</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Follow me close, for I will speak to them.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>And but one word with one of us? couple it with</a>
				<br/>
				<a>something; make it a word and a blow.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>TYBALT</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you</a>
				<br/>
				<a>will give me occasion.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Could you not take some occasion without giving?</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>TYBALT</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an</a>
				<br/>
				<a>thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but</a>
				<br/>
				<a>discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall</a>
				<br/>
				<a>make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>BENVOLIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>We talk here in the public haunt of men:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Either withdraw unto some private place,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And reason coldly of your grievances,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.</a>

				<p>
					<i>Enter ROMEO</i>

			<a>
				<b>TYBALT</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>MERCUTIO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>TYBALT</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford</a>
				<br/>
				<a>No better term than this,--thou art a villain.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Doth much excuse the appertaining rage</a>
				<br/>
				<a>To such a greeting: villain am I none;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>TYBALT</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries</a>
				<br/>
				<a>That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>I do protest, I never injured thee,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>But love thee better than thou canst devise,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender</a>
				<br/>
				<a>As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.</a>

				<br/>
				<a>shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the</a>

				<br/>
				<a>Your high displeasure: all this uttered</a>

				<a>With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,</a>

				<a>Could not take truce with the unruly spleen</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts</a>
				<br/>
				<a>With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Cold death aside, and with the other sends</a>

				<a>As Phaethon would whip you to the west,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And bring in cloudy night immediately.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Lovers can see to do their amorous rites</a>
				<br/>
				<a>By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And learn me how to lose a winning match,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,</a>

				<a>With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,</a>

				<a>Think true love acted simple modesty.</a>

				<a>Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;</a>

				<a>Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Take him and cut him out in little stars,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And he will make the face of heaven so fine</a>
				<br/>
				<a>That all the world will be in love with night</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And pay no worship to the garish sun.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>O, I have bought the mansion of a love,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,</a>
