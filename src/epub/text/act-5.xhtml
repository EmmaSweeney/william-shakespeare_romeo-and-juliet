			<h3>SCENE I. Mantua. A street.</h3>

			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave</a>
				<br/>
				<a>to think!--</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>That I revived, and was an emperor.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!</a>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<i>Enter BALTHASAR, booted</i>
				</p>
				<a>News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?</a>
				<br/>
				<a>How doth my lady? Is my father well?</a>
				<br/>
				<a>How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>For nothing can be ill, if she be well.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>BALTHASAR</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And her immortal part with angels lives.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And presently took post to tell it you:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Since you did leave it for my office, sir.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>BALTHASAR</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>I do beseech you, sir, have patience:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Your looks are pale and wild, and do import</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Some misadventure.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Tush, thou art deceived:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>BALTHASAR</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>No, my good lord.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>No matter: get thee gone,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.</a>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<i>Exit BALTHASAR</i>
				</p>
				<a>Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift</a>
				<br/>
				<a>To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!</a>
				<br/>
				<a>I do remember an apothecary,--</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted</a>
				<br/>
				<a>In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>An alligator stuff'd, and other skins</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</a>
				<br/>
				<a>A beggarly account of empty boxes,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Noting this penury, to myself I said</a>
				<br/>
				<a>'An if a man did need a poison now,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Whose sale is present death in Mantua,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'</a>
				<br/>
				<a>O, this same thought did but forerun my need;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And this same needy man must sell it me.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>As I remember, this should be the house.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>What, ho! apothecary!</a>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<i>Enter Apothecary</i>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>Apothecary</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Who calls so loud?</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have</a>
				<br/>
				<a>A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear</a>
				<br/>
				<a>As will disperse itself through all the veins</a>
				<br/>
				<a>That the life-weary taker may fall dead</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And that the trunk may be discharged of breath</a>
				<br/>
				<a>As violently as hasty powder fired</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>Apothecary</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Is death to any he that utters them.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>The world affords no law to make thee rich;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>Apothecary</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>My poverty, but not my will, consents.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>Apothecary</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>Put this in any liquid thing you will,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And drink it off; and, if you had the strength</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>ROMEO</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Doing more murders in this loathsome world,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Come, cordial and not poison, go with me</a>
				<br/>
				<a>To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.</a>
				<br/>
				<p>
					<i>Exeunt</i>

			<h3>SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<i>Enter FRIAR JOHN</i>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>FRIAR JOHN</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>

			<a>

			</a>
			<blockquote>
				<a>This same should be the voice of Friar John.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?</a>

				<a>Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>
				<b>FRIAR JOHN</b>
			</a>
			<blockquote>

				<br/>
				<a>One of our order, to associate me,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Here in this city visiting the sick,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And finding him, the searchers of the town,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Suspecting that we both were in a house</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Where the infectious pestilence did reign,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;</a>
				<br/>

				<a>So fearful were they of infection.</a>
				<br/>
			</blockquote>
			<a>

			<blockquote>
				<a>Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>The letter was not nice but full of charge</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Of dear import, and the neglecting it</a>
				<br/>
				<a>May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Unto my cell.</a>
				<br/>

				<a>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Betroth'd and would have married her perforce</a>
				<br/>
				<a>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean</a>
				<br/>
				<a>To rid her from this second marriage,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</a>
				<br/>
				<a>As I intended, for it wrought on her</a>
				<br/>
				<a>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>That he should hither come as this dire night,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Being the time the potion's force should cease.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Return'd my letter back. Then all alone</a>
				<br/>
				<a>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>But when I came, some minute ere the time</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</a>
				<br/>
				<a>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</a>
				<br/>
				<a>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</a>
				<br/>
				<a>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</a>
				<br/>
				<a>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</a>
				<br/>
				<a>All this I know; and to the marriage</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</a>
				<br/>
				<a>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</a>
